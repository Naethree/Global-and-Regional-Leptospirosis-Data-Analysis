# Next Steps

## 1. Create a Dashboard

### Objective
Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize the leptospirosis data. The dashboard will provide insights into the distribution of cases and deaths across different regions and years.

### Tasks
- **Design the Dashboard**: Define the key metrics and visualizations required, such as maps, bar charts, and time series plots.
- **Choose a Framework**: Decide on the framework for the dashboard. Possible options include:
  - [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
  - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
  - [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
- **Implement the Dashboard**: Develop the dashboard using the chosen framework.
- **Integrate Data**: Ensure the dashboard pulls data from the MongoDB database and updates in real-time or on-demand.
- **Test and Deploy**: Test the dashboard for usability and performance, then deploy it to a server or cloud platform.

### Expected Outcomes
- An interactive, user-friendly dashboard providing insights into global and regional leptospirosis data.

## 2. Implement Forecasting

### Objective
Implement forecasting models to predict future leptospirosis cases and deaths based on historical data.

### Tasks
- **Data Preparation**: Clean and prepare the data for forecasting. This may involve feature engineering and data transformation.
- **Choose Forecasting Models**: Evaluate and select appropriate forecasting models. Possible models include:
  - [ARIMA](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/tsa.html#arima)
  - [Exponential Smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing)
  - [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)
- **Build Forecasting Models**: Train the selected models on historical data.
- **Evaluate Model Performance**: Assess the accuracy of the forecasting models using appropriate metrics.
- **Integrate Forecasting Results**: Incorporate the forecasting results into the dashboard or generate reports.
- **Refine and Update**: Continuously refine the models based on new data and feedback.

### Expected Outcomes
- Predictive insights into future trends of leptospirosis cases and deaths, aiding in proactive public health measures.

## 3. Documentation and Finalization

### Objective
Complete the documentation and finalize the project for release.

### Tasks
- **Update README**: Include new features and instructions in the `README.md`.
- **Document Code**: Ensure that all code is well-documented and commented.
- **Prepare Final Reports**: Compile any analysis results and forecasting insights into a final report or presentation.
- **Review and Merge**: Review all changes, ensure that they meet project goals, and merge any development branches.

### Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive documentation and a finalized project ready for deployment or presentation.
